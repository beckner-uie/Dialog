# collab-practice
Use this to get in the habit of using git pull and git troubleshooting

Step 1. Choose a partner and one of you creates a repo titled Dialog

Step 2. The person who created the repo creates a index.html file and writes their name and a question for the other person. Push changes.

Step 3. Second person clones the repo to THEIR computer, writes their name and answers the question. Then they put a question of their own and push.

Step 4. The first person now has to pull the changes, answer the question, and then push a new question to the partner. So on and so forth until like, each person has 3 questions or whatever stopping point you like.
